            "- The fitbit app needs to have access to your location data",
            "- If you have an iPhone location data for the fitbit app has to be set to “always” instead of “when using the app”",
            "- Your fitbit device needs to be connected to your phone via Bluetooth",
            "- You also have to allow the watch face to use your location data and connect to the Internet (This usually happens when you check the boxes while installing the app)",
            "- Weather is also only shown when the watch detects that it is on your body"
