            "- Make sure your phone has a Internet connection and location data is activated",
            "- The fitbit app needs to have access to your location data",
            "- If you have an iPhone or an Android 10 device, location data for the fitbit app has to be set to “always” instead of “when using the app”",
            "- Your fitbit device needs to be connected to your phone via Bluetooth",
            "- You also have to allow the watch face to use your location data and connect to the Internet (This usually happens when you check the boxes while installing the app)",
            "- Weather is also only shown when the watch detects that it is on your body"

        "Now you should see the currently installed watchface and three dots in the top right corner. After you pressed on the three dots, press the 'Settings' button at the bottom of the screen. Now the screen should show the watchface settings."
